# alphasignx
Python library for communicating with Adaptive Microsystems digital LED signs that use the Alpha Communications Protocol.


This project is still under very early development, and is not at all optimized for outside usage at this moment. It is currently best for my setup. That being said, you are free to use the code as you wish if you can figure out how to make it work with your setup as I work on it.

It is meant to be a replacement for the outdated alphasign library, which no longer works on current versions of Python.
